# Float value simulator

`float_simulator` is a Python library that allows to generate float values that look like real world data. The data is
modeled after provided arguments and will have normal distribution.

## Why use float_simulator instead of other libraries

As each generated value is based on the previous value the result set will look and measure like real world sensor data.
Libraries like `numpy` offer also normal distributed values but these values are unordered. E.g. we have a temperature
sensor with an average value of 6.4Â° and a standard deviation of 0.2. The order of values are completely different when
simulating those values with the `float_simulator` and `numpy`.

### Order of values

`float_simulator` 10.000 values, with `mean=6.4`, `stdev=0.2`:

`numpy` 10.000 values, with `loc=6.4`, `scale=0.2`:

## Using float_simulator

Instantiate a `FloatSimulator` object and calculate a number of values for it:

```python
from tsperf.util.float_simulator import FloatSimulator

mean = 5
min = 3
max = 7
stdev = 0.3
variance = 0.01

sensor = FloatSimulator(mean, min, max, stdev, variance)
sensor_values = []

for i in range(0, 10000):
    sensor_values.append(sensor.calculate_next_value())
```

`sensor_values` is now an array of 10.000 consecutive values generated by the FloatSimulator.

## Errors

As real world data, especially sensor readings, contain errors the `float_simulator` also includes an option to
simulate errors. The two optional arguments `error_rate` and `error_length` set the error behaviour of the
`float_simulator`.

Currently errors take a random value below or above the minimum and maximum arguments. A more sophisticated behaviour
is on the road map for the next release.

### error_rate

The `error_rate` is the chance to encounter an error in percent with `1` meaning an error is encountered 100% of the
time and `0.01` meaning an error is encountered 1% of the time.

### error_length

The `error_length` is the duration for how many values an error is sustained it's value is also interpreted as percent
but each iteration reduced by 1. E.g. a value of `1.9` means the error is sustained for 1 more value and then has a 90%
chance to be maintained an additional value. If an error has been encountered the minimum chance of maintaining an error
value is `0.01` or 1%.
